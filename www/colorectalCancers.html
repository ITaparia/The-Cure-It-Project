						<br />
						
						Colorectal Cancers are cancers that start in either the colon or rectum. They are often grouped together due to the similarities that they share with one another. There are several different types of Colorectal Cancers, each with their own properties that warrant individualized attention. The three that we will be taking a look at are Adenocarcinomas, Sarcomas, and Carcinoid tumors.						
    <br />
    <br />  
					Colorectal Cancers are often very preventable due to the relatively predictable way in which they develop. The vast majority of Colorectal Cancers begin as a polyp, which typically begin developing in the inner lining of the colon or rectum. Some (but not all) of these polyps will develop into Colorectal Cancer if left untreated. This means that one of the best ways to prevent Colorectal Cancers is to remove these polyps early. Recent advancements in technology have brought with them <span class = "link" onClick = "http://www.cancer.org/cancer/colonandrectumcancer/detailedguide/colorectal-cancer-detection">an enhanced understanding</span> of how to do this, something which has been useful in somewhat quelling the threat of Colorectal Cancers. 
		
					 	<br />
					    <br />
						
						Let us now take a closer look at each individual type of Colorectal Cancer in order to grasp an increased understanding of how they impact people everywhere. Below is a chart that details the percent occurance of the most common form of Colorectal Cancer, Adenocarcinomas. As you can see, the <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.wcrf.org/int/cancer-facts-figures/data-specific-cancers/colorectal-cancer-statistics')">vast majority</span> of Colorectal Cancers stem from this disease.

										<p>
											Adenocarcinomas are by far the most common form of Colorectal Cancer, claiming <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/bowel-cancer/about/types-of-bowel-cancer')">95 percent</span> of diagnosal cases. This form of cancer often begins in the inner layer of the bowel before spreading into other, deeper layers. Because of this, early detection and treatment is essential in terms of ensuring that the cancer does not become life threatening. 
											
											
											<br />
											<br />
											There are several types of Adenocarcinomas, but the most dangerous are Signet Ring Cell Adenocarcinomas. While these only account for <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancercenter.com/colorectal-cancer/types/tab/colorectal-adenocarcinoma/')">less than one percent</span> of all Adenocarcinomas, they are <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.pmppals.org/signet-ring-cell-adenocarcinoma.html')">typically very agressive</span>. 
											They are very difficult to treat in the vast majority of cases.
								
											
											<br />
											<br />
											This is a very common form of cancer, with well over 100,000 cases occuring each year in the United States alone. While the lethality of this form of cancer varies greatly on the time in which it is detected, an average of <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cap.org/apps/docs/reference/myBiopsy/ColonAdenocarcinoma.pdf')">50 percent</span> of patients survive 5 years of more after contracting the disease. Survival rates in patients that achieve early detection are more comforting, with anywhere from <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cap.org/apps/docs/reference/myBiopsy/ColonAdenocarcinoma.pdf')">70 to 80 percent</span> of these patients reaching this same milestone. That said, more research is required to ensure that these promising odds are afforded to all Adenocarcinoma patients.

									<dt><a class="accordionTitle" href="#" style = "background-color: #F7464A">Sarcomas</a></dt>
									<dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
										<p>
											Sarcomas are cancers that <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/bowel-cancer/about/types-of-bowel-cancer')">develop in the bone or muscle</span>. The growth of this cancer causes pressure on the body and organs that can sometimes result in the infected cells being spread around the body. While they technically have the potential to spread to <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/sarcoma/about/about-sarcomas')">nearly any site in the body</span>, the most common place to spread is to the lungs or bones. 
											
											
				
											
											
											
											
											<br />
											<br />
											Like all forms of Colorectal Cancers, early detection is the key to ensuring a quick and efficient treatment. The earlier the cancer is discovered, the less likely it is to have spread, thus allowing for the <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/sarcoma/treatment/which-treatment-for-soft-tissue-sarcoma')">removal of the cancerous cells through surgeries</span>. However, more complex cases of Sarcoma may mean that radiotherapy and chemotherapy must be used in order to reduce the tumor in size before surgery.

										<dt><a class="accordionTitle" href="#" style = "background-color: #46BFBD">Carcinoids</a></dt>
									<dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
										<p>
											Carcinoids are an especially slow growing form of Colorectal Cancer. While this has the advantage of ensuring that the tumor is not especially fast-acting, it can also make early detection a challenge. Carcinoids often fail to produce symptoms until <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carcinoid-tumors/basics/definition/con-20030114')">late in the disease</span>, something which can mean that the tumor is advanced at the time of discovery. 
											
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
											Early detection of Carcinoids can sometimes make treatment a relatively simple manner, <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carcinoid-tumors/basics/treatment/con-20030114')">with a targeted surgery</span> removing or preventing the further development of the tumor. However, the low-profile nature of the cancer typically means that more advanced treatment plans are necessary, such as through medications, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Although recent advancements have yielded improvements in this regard, these treatment plans are often uncomfortable for the patient due to the slew of negative side effects that they involve.

						<br />
						As we've already covered, one of the most important factors in terms of ensuring that Colorectal Cancer does not become life-threatening is the stage in which the disease is discovered and removed. This can be seen simply by comparing the survival rates between the first and final stages of Colorectal Cancer, as there is a <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/colonandrectumcancer/detailedguide/colorectal-cancer-survival-rates')">whopping 81 percent difference</span> in 5-year survival rates between the two. Simply put, if we are to truly neutralize the threat of this terrible illness, advancements in understanding of the risk factors that lead to Colorectal Cancer is all but a necessity.

										<p>
											One of the most powerful tools that doctors and researchs have at their disposal to fight Colorectal Cancers is through early detection and prevention. The best way to do this is to grasp a more advanced knowledge of what actually causes the disease in the first place. There have been tremendous improvements made in this regard over the past decade and a half, something that has proven to be very useful in taking those first steps towards overcoming the issue as a whole.
                                            <br />
                                            <br />
											Many of the risk factors that researchers have identified are lifestyle related. These include things such as <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/colonandrectumcancer/detailedguide/colorectal-cancer-risk-factors')">smoking or the excessive consumption of alchohol</span>. Similarly, becoming overweight or failing to get a proper amount of physical activity can result in an increased risk for Colorectal Cancers. Because many of these factors are based on active choices in lifestyle, this knowledge has granted people everywhere to be more proactive about their health through the prevention of disease.
											
											<br />
											<br />
											Other factors are, unfortunately enough, are beyond the control of the individual. Aging is one example of this, as  <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/content/@epidemiologysurveilance/documents/document/acspc-028312.pdf')">90 percent of people diagnosed</span> with a form of Colorectal Cancers are above the age of 50. That said, it is still important to maintain a healthy lifestyle to ensure that the risk of contracting this disease is kept as low as possible. And as research continues to progress, scientists hope to uncover new trends that will enable them to take prevention to the next, more controllable, level.

											Recent discoveries have done much to allow researchers to utilize various drug combinations in their efforts to boost the survival rate of Colorectal Cancer patients. These drugs provide patients everywhere with more options, something that serves to enhance the comfort and health of those suffering from the disease.
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
												
											One of these drugs is <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/guidetocancerdrugs/irinotecan')">Irinotecan</span>, which is a chemotherapy drug that specifically attempts to block the action of an enzyme associated with keeping cancer cells in their proper form. Cancer cells typically divide far faster than healthy cells, and thus are more likely to be targeted by the drug. While side effects do exist, Irinotecan has proved itself to be a valuable tool in the arsenal of doctors, and has kept people healthy since its <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/guidetocancerdrugs/irinotecan')">approval by the FDA in 1996</span>. 
                                            <br />
                                            <br />
											
											Another drug recently approved for the treatment of Colorectal Cancers is <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://products.sanofi.us/eloxatin/eloxatin.html')">Eloxatin</span>. While it is typically used in combination with other drugs, the use of Eloxatin has been associated with a <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.webmd.com/colorectal-cancer/features/colorectal-cancer-new-treatments-improved-prognosis')">whopping 11 percent</span> in 5-year survival rates in some cases.
