                        Lung cancers are tumorous growths found in the lungs, taking over either the actual membrane of the lung, or the air holes inside the lung, which are essential for respiration. Lung cancers are responsible for 27% of deaths from all cancers, making it the leading cancer in terms of mortality. Despite the seriousness of lung cancer, when located early, it is easy to treat and remove. There are three primary types of Lung Cancer:<span onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/lungcancer-non-smallcell/index')" class = "link"> Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</span>(NSC Lung Cancer), <span onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/lungcancer-smallcell/index')" class = "link">Small Cell Lung Cancer</span>(SC Lung Cancer), and <span onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/lungcarcinoidtumor/index')" class = "link">Lung Carcinoids</span>. Details of each type will be throughly dicussed below.
						
						
						
						<br />
						<br />
						
                        Lung cancer is cancer that starts in the lungs. The lungs are located in the chest. When you breathe, air goes through your nose, down your windpipe (trachea), and into the lungs, where it spreads through tubes called bronchi. <span onClick = "window.open('http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0004529/')"class = "link">Most lung cancers begins in the cells that line these tubes.</span> One of the most well known causes of this deadly disease is through the use of cigarattes or another carcinogenic inhalent.
						
						<br />
						<br />
						
						Lets begin by going through the specifics of each type of lung cancer as highlighted above. The graph below reveals the 3 different types of lung cancers, and how prevalent they are in all total lung cancer cases. The clear leader is NSC Lung Cancer, with SC Lung Cancer comprising of 15% of all lung cancer cases, and Lung Carcinoids consisting of only 5% of total lung cancer cases.

                                            Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, or just NSC Lung Cancer for short, is by far, the most common type of lung cancer. To understand what not only NSC Lung Cancer is, but what Lung Cancer as a whole is, we must first understand the <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.webmd.com/lung/how-we-breathe')">basic workings of the lungs.</span> When a person breathes in, the fresh oxygen goes directly to the bronchi, two large tubes that feed into the lungs, and eventually branch off into smaller braches calle bronchioles. The clean oxygen is held in tiny sacs called alveoli in these bronchioles, and the blood pumping through your body takes absorbs that oxygen and replaces it with dirty, non-resuable carbon dioxide(CO2). Once the CO2 is held in the alveoli sacs, you exhale it all out, and thus keeping your body fresh with the oxygen it needs to survive.
                                            
                                                <br />
                                                <br />
                                               
                                               When NSC Lung Cancer is formed, it usually starts in the tiny branches of the bronchioles, and initially, there is no noticbale tumor growth. The only abnormal growth that can be seen is under a microscope, with unusually large amounts of DNA being produced. Over time, the abnormal cells may acquire other gene changes, which cause them to progress to true cancer. As a cancer develops, the cancer cells may make chemicals that cause new blood vessels to form nearby. These blood vessels nourish the cancer cells, which can continue to grow and form a tumor large enough to be seen on imaging tests such as x-rays.
                                               
                                                <br />
                                                <br />
                                               
                                            <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007194.htm')">NSC Lung Cancer is especially dangerous because of how easy it metastasizes (spreads).</span> Remember how we said that the blood comes to all those tiny sacs called the alveoli? This system proves to be extremely effective in carrying the cancer cells to other part of the body, which is evenutally the killer of most cancer patients. What makes it even more threatening is the fact that it tends to spread in this way even before it can be detected on an imaging test such as a chest x-ray.
                    
                                               
                                                <br />
                                                <br />
                                                 
                                    If this tumor isnt treated quickly, the cancerous cells will actually continue to grow, and invade most of the tiny alveoli in the body. Because the cancer restricts oxygen transfer to the blood, NSC Lung Cancer can result in harsh, raspy sounds when you breathe, coughing up blood or mucus, and lasting lung problems like pneumonia and bronchitis, which can eventually kill a person

                                            Before discussing the specifics of SC Lung Cancer, first let us distinguish <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/lungcancer-smallcell/detailedguide/small-cell-lung-cancer-what-is-small-cell-lung-cancer')">SC Lung Cancer from NSC Lung Cancer.</span> As is apparent from the name, the actual size of the cancerous cells are much smaller in size, and are only visible through a microscope, making this even more dangerous than NSC Lung Cancer. Another difference is that while NSC Lung Cancer starts in the bronchioles, SC Lung Cancer actually starts in the bronchi, one of the two big main pipes that lead into your lungs, allowing for faster spreading throughout the body. This disease only affects 15-20% of the total Lung Cancer cases, but is still a major threat.
											
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
                                            Another key difference between NSC and SC Lung Cancer is that SC Lung Cancer <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.emedicinehealth.com/small-cell_lung_cancer/article_em.htm')">responds much better to treatment methods like chemotherapy and radiation therapy. </span> Even though SC Lung Cancer is able to spread extremely quickly due to the region in which it grows, it becomes much easier to tackle the SC Lung Cancer with the methods mentioned above.
											
											
											
											
											
											<br />
											<br />
                                            The symptoms of SC Lung Cancer do not differ much from those of NSC Lung Cancer, except for one thing. Small-cell lung cancer is frequently associated with distinct <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraneoplastic_syndrome')">paraneoplastic syndromes</span> (collection of symptoms that result from substances produced by the tumor, occurring far away from the tumor).

                                            Lung Carcinoids are an extremely rare form of Lung Cancer, accounting for only 5% of all Lung Cancer cases. Lung Carcinoids are extremely different from the other two types of lung cancer, as they don't affect the physical pathways of the lungs, but rather special types of cells called <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_cell')">nueroendocrine cells</span> that produce hormones like adrenaline, that regulate and control the energy levels of lung cells.
									
										<br />
										<br />
										
                                            Lung Carcinoids are also different from NSC and SC Lung Cancers in terms of growth. <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.emedicinehealth.com/carcinoid_lung_tumor/article_em.htm')">Lung Carcinoids move very, very slow when compared to the other two types.</span> The reason for this is because the other two types utilize the circulatory system to carry cancer cells, and blood moves very rapidly throughout the body. Carcinoids take longer because they mimic hormones, which are inherently slower than blood transfer. An example would be adrenaline. Adrenaline doesnt immediately cut off, it ebbs away and takes its time for the effects to be reduced, and these same principles apply to Lung Carcinoids.

                            Through the constant effort of ever-committed medical staff, and through the countless leaps in advanced technology, the mortality rates of Lung Cancer, the deadliest cancer in the world, has been steadily going down since 1993 by over 15%, and will continue throught the constant efforts of the world.

						New technological advancements have proven to be very effective in terms of treating Blood Cancer patients. Take Leukemia for example - as can be seen below, the general trends that dictate the deaths resulting from this type of cancer have generally been positive.	In fact, the 5-year cancer survival rate increased by a <a href = "http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/leuks.html" class = "link" target="_blank">whopping 26 percent between 1975 and 2005</a>.

                                            Once a patient is diagnosed with any form of Lung Cancer, the best doctors and other medical staff work with the patient to create the best possible treatment plan. <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.healthline.com/health/doctors-for-lung-cancer#Overview1')">There are a total of 3 specialized doctors that work with lung cancers.</span> The oncologist is a general cancer doctor that establishes the optimal treatment plan for the patient. The pulminologist is a doctor who specializes in treating diseases of the lungs, such as lung cancer, COPD, and tuberculosis. With cancer, a pulmonologist aids in diagnosis and treatment. Lastly, the thoracic surgeon specialize in surgery of the chest (thorax). They perform operations on the throat, lungs, and heart.

											<br />
											
                                            Depending on the type and stage of the cancer and other factors, treatment options for lung cancer can include: <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/lung-cancer/treatment-options')">Surgery, radiation therapy, laser therapy, chemotherapy, and certain types of targeted therapy.</span> Sometimes, more than one of type of treatment might be used.

The lungs typically have five lobes, three in the right lung and two in the left lung. Lobectomy is a very effective method of surgery, even when the tumor is small.
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
                                            Lobectomy usually takes out an entire lobe, specifically the one with the cancerous cells. Even if one lobe is taken out, the lungs still function and provide oxygen to the body, albeit at a lesser rate and with some difficulties.

                                            This type of surgery has many side effects afterwards, and is usually very risky, but it has always served well in terminating the growth of cancer after the surgery is over.

                           Even though Lung Cancer is a heavily researched form of cancer, it still remains at large as the single largest contributor to cancer-related deaths. While progress has certaintly been made in recent years, further research is required to make this Eye Cancer an issue of the past. Fotunately, the organizations detailed below all provide a valuable opportunity to right this wrong, and to ensure that Lung Cancer is allocated the research that it deserves and requires.
