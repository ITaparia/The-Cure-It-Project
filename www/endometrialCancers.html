						Loosely defined,  <span onClick = "window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_cancer')" class = "link">Endometiral Cancer</span> is the uncontrollable growth of cells that originates in the lining of the womb (the uterus). There are two different types of Endometrial Cancers, <span onClick = "window.open('http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/254083-overview')" class = "link">Endometrial Carcinomas</span>, and <span onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/uterinesarcoma/')" class = "link">Uterine Sarcomas</span>. These 2 forms of cancer will be discussed in great detail below.
						
						
						
						
						
						<br />
						<br />
						
						Endromenial Cancer is highly treatable in all but its latest stages, with average 5-year survival rates only dipping below 50 percent in the <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/endometrialcancer/detailedguide/endometrial-uterine-cancer-survival-rates')">later portions of stage III</span>. Because Endometrial Cancers start in the uterus, or the cells that surround the uterus, the disease only affects females. The threat of Endometiral Cancer can be long-term, with fertility being threatened in certain cases. The likelyhood of such an outcome increases when the cancer metastasizes (spreads) throughout the body. 
						
						<br />
						<br />
						
						Let's start off by discussing each individual type of Endometrial Cancer. As shown through the graph below, Endometrial Carcinomas are easily the most common type of Endometrial Cancer, accounting for <span onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/endometrialcancer/detailedguide/endometrial-uterine-cancer-key-statistics')" class = "link"> 92% of all cases</span>. Uterine Sarcomas make up the rest of the cases.

											Endometrial Carcinomas are cancers that begin in the inner lining of the uterus. The uterus is composed of two distinct layers: the inner layer is the endometrium, and the outer layer is the myometrium. Encometrial Carcinomas are defined as  the uncontrollable growth of abnormal cells in the endometrium.
							
                                                <br />
                                                <br />
												
												Many scientists have come to the conclusion that this form of Endometrial Cancer is due to an abnormally high presence of <span onClick = "window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen')" class = "link">estrogen</span> in the body. The medical outlook associated with this form of cancer is generally positive, with <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/endometrialcancer/detailedguide/endometrial-uterine-cancer-what-is-endometrial-cancer')">the majority of healthy glands being preserved</span> in the earlier stages of the cancer. 
												 This, combined with the relatively unaggressive nature of the cancer, can sometimes result in a failure to recognize the potential danger that the disease holds, as type I Endometrial Cancers typically do <span onClick = "window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis')" class = "link">metastasize (spread)</span> fairly easily. 
												
												
												
                                                <br />
                                                <br />
												
												Many of the symptoms of Endometrial Carcinomas are quite visible, with a major indicator being defined by the presence of <span onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/endometrialcancer/detailedguide/endometrial-uterine-cancer-signs-and-symptoms')" class = "link">abnormal vaginal bleeding</span>. This can involve anything from a drastic change in the duration of a period or the time that passes in between periods. While such symptoms are not always indicative of Endometrial Carcinomas, it is important to get these issues examined by a medical professional to prevent future problems. 
												
                                                <br />

											While Uterine Sarcomas are far less common than Endometrial Carcinomas, they share so much in common that comparisons between them are inevitable. Like Endometrial Carcinomas, Euterine Sarcomas typically originate in the endometrium. Tehy are <span onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/endometrialcancer/detailedguide/endometrial-uterine-cancer-what-is-endometrial-cancer')" class = "link">often much more aggressive than Endometiral Carcinomas</span>, something that explains why they are often refered to as the 2nd form of Endometrial Carcinomas. Because of this, Uterine Sarcomas are more likely to spread throughout the body. 
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
											Thankfully, the many symptoms that indicate the presence of Uterine Sarcomas are relatively visible and as a result make it easier to detect this form of cancer before advanced development can be achieved. These include: <span onClick = "window.open('http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endometrial-cancer/basics/definition/con-20033696?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=abstract&utm_content=Endometrial-cancer&utm_campaign=Knowledge-panel')" class = "link">vaginal bleeding, pain in the cervix, massive weight loss, and widespread fatiuge</span>.

											The first thing that happens when a patient is diagnosed with any form of Endometrial Cancer is the formation of a treatment plan that is specifically suited to fit the patient's needs. The <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/cancer-basics/cancer-care-team/types-oncologists')">oncologist</span> is a general cancer doctor that establishes the optimal treatment roadmap for the patient. The <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_medicine_physician')">nuclear medicine doctor</span> is a specialist who applies radioactive substances to diagnose and treat various endometrial tumors. Lastly, the <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.healthcommunities.com/pregnancy/what-is-obgyn.shtml')">OBGYN Doctor</span> is an expert who focuses on reproductive health in women and studies the behavior of the eterus in terms of how it reacts to the cancer.  
											
                                            
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
											Depending on the type and stage of the tumor and other factors, treatment options for Endometrial Cancer can include: <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/endometrialcancer/detailedguide/endometrial-uterine-cancer-treating-general-info')">Surgery (Hysterectomy), radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy</span>. Sometimes, more than one type of treatment plan is used in order to ensure maximum effectiveness. When choosing which treatment plan is best for the patient, doctors consider the location and stage of the cancer, the patient's overall health, the chances of curing the disease, and the possible impact of the treatment on the uterus.

                                            For many women, surgery is the go-to treatment for Endometrial Cancer of any form. The specific type of surgery that is done is called a <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterectomy')">hysterectomy</span>. A hysterectomy involves removing the uterus as well as any other troublesome satellite structures of the uterus such as the cervix or ovaries. While the basic idea behind a hysterectomy has not changed over the past couple of years, advancements in our understanding of how the uterus functions has made the surgery more effective and safe. 
											
											
											<br />
											<br />
											The goal when conducting a hysterectomy is to control the growth of the cancerous cells through the removal of tumors. Thus, the surgery is most effective when treating type I Endometrial Carcinomas, as many of the tumors associated with this form of cancer have yet to spread beyond the place of origin. It is not uncommon for the entire uterus to be removed in order to completely eradicate all cancerous cells from the body. 
											
											
                                            <br />

											There has been a massive effort over the past few decades to improve this form of surgery to ensure a higher degree of success. In adherance to this fact, medical facilities all around the world have <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.davincihysterectomy.com/')">adopted robotic systems that guide these surgeries</span>, offering up the enhanced precision necessary to save lives.

To be more specific, the <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progestin')">progestin</span> family of hormones cause cancerous cells to react in a manner that is useful for containing the spread of Endometrial Cancer.

The purpose of these two drugs is to rapidly slow ultimately destroy the cancerous cells in the uterus. These drugs are often combined to achieve powerful effects that rarely affect the quality of life for the patient. Therapy of this kind is useful in cases when more intrusive treatment methods such as chemotherapy are not an option.

						While the decreasing mortality rates from Endometrial Cancers are certainly something to be celebrated, the disease still claims upwards of 10,000 patients each and every year. Additionally, the <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/endometrialcancer/detailedguide/endometrial-uterine-cancer-key-statistics)">incidence rate of the disease</span> has shown no sign of letting up, spreading Endometrial Cancer's influence to thousands more.
