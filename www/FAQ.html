						Cancer is an immensely complex topic, and that sort of complexity often warrants comparable explanations. While the internet has provided the general public with a great deal of information on the subject, it can sometimes be difficult to get clear answers to what seem like basic questions. The purpose of this section is to remedy that problem, providing you with answers to these questions that can truly be understood by anyone, regardless of exposure to the subject or prior medical knowledge.

									<dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
										<p>
											We often hear the term 'stage of cancer' being thrown around when discussing the development level of the cancer at the time of diagnosis. However, many lack an understanding for what each of the stages actually mean. The stages of cancer exist as a reference system through which doctors can plan <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/detection/staging')">an appropriate treatment plan and estimate a patient's prognosis</span>. There are 5 primary stages of cancer that are important to know.  
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
											<span class = "slight_header">Stage O</span> - This is used to identify a cancer which is isolated to a singular place of origin. This means that the cancer <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/diagnosing-cancer/stages-cancer')">has not invaded nearby tissue</span>. It is ideal to discover the cancer at this stage, as its static state of development often means that doctors have the opportunity to remove it through surgery before it becomes a larger issue. 
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
											<span class = "slight_header">Stage I</span> - This stage of cancer is defined when the cancerous cells have <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/diagnosing-cancer/stages-cancer')">begun to invade neighboring tissue</span>. While the disease is usually still under control at this point, this can often be a very frightening step, as it means that the cancer has the potential to threaten life. 
											
											<br />
											<br /> 
											
											<span class = "slight_header">Stage II and Stage III</span> - These stages of cancer are declared when the cancer has begun to spread in the general region of the body in which it first developed but has not extended past this point. Surgery and Chemo or Radio therapies may be necessary at this point to prevent the disease from growing further. 
											
											<br />
											<br /> 
											
											<span class = "slight_header">Stage IV</span> - This stage of cancer occurs when the cancer has spread to other locations in the body. It may enter the blood stream and form colonies at various points around the body. Cancer at this stage is sometimes described as being <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/diagnosing-cancer/stages-cancer')">advanced or metastatic</span>.

									<dt><a class="accordionTitle" href="#" style = "background-color: #1FDA9A">How much does cancer treatment cost?</a></dt>
									<dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
										<p>
											Cancer can be an incredibly expensive problem to deal with. While the <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://costprojections.cancer.gov/annual.costs.html')">cost of care varies greatly</span> depending on the type and severity of the cancer, it is not uncommon for annual cost to be tens or even hundreds of thousands of United States dollars. Nearly everything associated with cancer treatment is expensive, and these towering expenses are the product of doctor visits, lab tests, chemo and radio therapy treatments, hospital visits, surgeries, <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/treatment/findingandpayingfortreatment/managinginsuranceissues/the-cost-of-cancer-treatment')">and more</span>. 
											<br />
											<br />
											Luckily, proper health insurance can do much to keep many of this financial burden from coming out of the patient's pocket. In fact, <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.bankrate.com/finance/insurance/insuring-costs-cancer-1.aspx')">health insurance typically covers</span> medical expenses, doctor and hospital visits, and many forms of drugs and medications. 
											
											<br />
											<br />
											In summary, while the costs of cancer are tremendous, there do exist ways to keep this burden from being a distraction while the patient undergoes treatment. That said, it is a good idea to fully understand your insurance plan and its limits, as the consequences can be severe for the underprepared individual. 
											
											<br />
											<br />
											Cancer patients should be focused on getting better, not managing a complex financial situation in the face of disease. One of the best ways you can reduce the financial burden on cancer patients is to <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('donate.html')">donate to charities associated with cancer treatments</span>, as many of them are involved with supporting tens of thousands of patients financially each and every year.

Although normal cells can sometimes be damaged through this practice, they can typically repair themselves. 
										<br />
										<br />
										<span class = "slight_header">Metastasis</span> - The spread of cancer from the point of origin of the disease <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/treatment/understandingyourdiagnosis/advancedcancer/advanced-cancer-what-is-metastatic')">to another location in the body</span>. The cancer is often much harder to contain once metastasis has occured. 
										
										<br />
										<br />
										<span class = "slight_header">Remission</span> - A cancer patient is in remission when cancer symptoms disapear or are reduced. This is referred to as partial remission and complete remission respectively.

									<dd class="accordionItem2 accordionItemCollapsed2">
										<p>
											The 5-year survival rate is a tool that doctors use to gauge how deadly a particular varient of cancer is. For instance, the <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/lung/cancer-survival-prognosis')">5-year survival rate for lung cancer is 16 percent</span>. This means that 16 out of every 100 people survive 5 years or more after being diagnosed with their illness. This does not mean that the chances for survival for any particular individual are 16 percent: each case is different, and it is important to avoid applying blanket statistics such as these to indidual cases. 
													
											<br />
											<br />
											Surviving 5 years is an indication to many that the treatment has been effective and recovery is an option. One common misconception is that 5-year survival means that it is impossible for these patients to survive past 5 years. <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/lung/cancer-survival-prognosis')">This is not true</span> - many cancer patients go on to lead happy, healthy, and full lives. 5-year survival rates are just that: a number. It is important for patients to not take too much stock in it and instead focus on their own individual case.

						Colorectal Cancer is one of the most prominent forms of cancer currently active in the world today. It claims tens of thousands of lives each and every year, and tears lives apart through the crippling effect that it can sometimes have on those who experience it. Thankfully, there do exist a number of organizations with the courage and foresight to stand against this terrible disease. All of the options below are valuable resources with which to take an active stance against Colorectal Cancers.

											<span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://fightcolorectalcancer.org')">Fight Colorectal Cancer</span> has been on the front lines of the fight against Colorectal Cancers for years now. They have dedicated themselves to promoting the development of new treatments as well as making sure the public is well educated on the causes of Colorectal Cancers, something that has done much to inspire hope in those who suffer from it. 
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
											They fight against Colorectal Cancers in five main ways: advocacy, awareness generation, providing patients with resources, funding research, and philanthropy. All of these efforts have combined to make them a fortible contender in the fight against this disease. They have managed to do all of this while ensuring financial and ethical transparency, achieving an <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=13819#.VOZbGcaJmFI')">A+ rating on Charity Navigator</span> in this regard. 
											
											<br />
											<br />
											In addition to this, they have optained a <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=13819#.VOZcjcaJmFJ')">4 star rating</span> on Charity Navigator, meaning that all funds donated to them will be allocated responsibly and in a manner that is consistent with those who aim to fight Colorectal Cancers. You can join them in their battle by clicking on the button below to donate.

											The <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.eifoundation.org/programs/eifs-national-colorectal-cancer-research-alliance')">NCCRA (National Colorectal Cancer Alliance)</span> has made it their mission to eradicate the threat of Colorectal Cancers once and for all. They attempt to do this by promoting and raising funding for medical screenings, scientific tests, and treatments. They hope that their efforts will one day prove successful enough to yield a cure, and they have been selflessly pursuing this goal since their founding in 2000.	
											
											<br />
											<br />
											They have raised well over 33 million dollars to date, and have provided thousands of patients with advanced technologies that make their lives more comfortable and fulfilling. One such advancement that they have funded has been the development of a <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.eifoundation.org/programs/eifs-national-colorectal-cancer-research-alliance/content/funding-cutting-edge-colorectal-c')">DNA-based stool test</span> that can detect the gene mutation that led to the occurance of the disease. This provides researches everywhere with more data with which to construct future treatment plans. 
											
											
											<br />
											<br />
											All of this has been accomplished while ensuring a great deal of financial transparency. They keep detailed records as to where donations are directed towards, and <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.eifoundation.org/programs/eifs-national-colorectal-cancer-research-alliance/content/where-does-money-go')">maintain a running list</span> of where the most prominent investments lie. It is through their contributions that researchers around the world can harness the tools that they need to make the issue of Colorectal Cancers one of the past. You can help them achieve this goal by clicking on the button below to donate.
