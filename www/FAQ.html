						Cancer is an immensely complex topic, and that sort of complexity often warrants comparable explanations. While the internet has provided the general public with a great deal of information on the subject, it can sometimes be difficult to get clear answers to what seem like basic questions. The purpose of this section is to remedy that problem, providing you with answers to these questions that can truly be understood by anyone, regardless of exposure to the subject or prior medical knowledge.

									<dt><a class="accordionTitle" href="#" style = "background-color:#28ABE3;">What do the stages of cancer mean?</a></dt>
									<dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
										<p>
											We often hear the term 'stage of cancer' being thrown around when discussing the development level of the cancer at the time of diagnosis. However, many lack an understanding for what each of the stages actually mean. The stages of cancer exist as a reference system through which doctors can plan <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/detection/staging')">an appropriate treatment plan and estimate a patient's prognosis</span>. There are 5 primary stages of cancer that are important to know.  
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
											<span class = "slight_header">Stage O</span> - This is used to identify a cancer which is isolated to a singular place of origin. This means that the cancer <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/diagnosing-cancer/stages-cancer')">has not invaded nearby tissue</span>. It is ideal to discover the cancer at this stage, as its static state of development often means that doctors have the opportunity to remove it through surgery before it becomes a larger issue. 
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
											<span class = "slight_header">Stage I</span> - This stage of cancer is defined when the cancerous cells have <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/diagnosing-cancer/stages-cancer')">begun to invade neighboring tissue</span>. While the disease is usually still under control at this point, this can often be a very frightening step, as it means that the cancer has the potential to threaten life. 
											
											<br />
											<br /> 
											
											<span class = "slight_header">Stage II and Stage III</span> - These stages of cancer are declared when the cancer has begun to spread in the general region of the body in which it first developed but has not extended past this point. Surgery and Chemo or Radio therapies may be necessary at this point to prevent the disease from growing further. 
											
											<br />
											<br /> 
											
											<span class = "slight_header">Stage IV</span> - This stage of cancer occurs when the cancer has spread to other locations in the body. It may enter the blood stream and form colonies at various points around the body. Cancer at this stage is sometimes described as being <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/diagnosing-cancer/stages-cancer')">advanced or metastatic</span>.

									<dt><a class="accordionTitle" href="#" style = "background-color: #1FDA9A">How much does cancer treatment cost?</a></dt>
									<dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
										<p>
											Cancer can be an incredibly expensive problem to deal with. While the <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://costprojections.cancer.gov/annual.costs.html')">cost of care varies greatly</span> depending on the type and severity of the cancer, it is not uncommon for annual cost to be tens or even hundreds of thousands of United States dollars. Nearly everything associated with cancer treatment is expensive, and these towering expenses are the product of doctor visits, lab tests, chemo and radio therapy treatments, hospital visits, surgeries, <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/treatment/findingandpayingfortreatment/managinginsuranceissues/the-cost-of-cancer-treatment')">and more</span>. 
											<br />
											<br />
											Luckily, proper health insurance can do much to keep many of this financial burden from coming out of the patient's pocket. In fact, <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.bankrate.com/finance/insurance/insuring-costs-cancer-1.aspx')">health insurance typically covers</span> medical expenses, doctor and hospital visits, and many forms of drugs and medications. 
											
											<br />
											<br />
											In summary, while the costs of cancer are tremendous, there do exist ways to keep this burden from being a distraction while the patient undergoes treatment. That said, it is a good idea to fully understand your insurance plan and its limits, as the consequences can be severe for the underprepared individual. 
											
											<br />
											<br />
											Cancer patients should be focused on getting better, not managing a complex financial situation in the face of disease. One of the best ways you can reduce the financial burden on cancer patients is to <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('donate.html')">donate to charities associated with cancer treatments</span>, as many of them are involved with supporting tens of thousands of patients financially each and every year.

										<p>
											It's not uncommon for medical terms to be thrown around when discussing cancer. While this site was written with the intention of being accessible to everybody, there are still some terms that are worth knowing in order to fully grasp the medical context of what cancer patients deal with everyday.
										<br />
										<br />
										<span class = "slight_header">Chemotherapy</span> - The use of drugs to combat cancer and its side effects. Chemotherapy can be <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.chemocare.com/chemotherapy/what-is-chemotherapy/what-is-chemotherapy-used-for.aspx#.VOeLrcaJmFI')">used for a variety of things</span>, including but not limited to: killing cancerous cells, preventing tumor growth, relieving symptoms, and shrinking tumors before surgury. 
										<br />
										<br />
										<span class = "slight_header">Radiotherapy</span> - The use of high energy rays to treat cancer by <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertreatment/Treatmenttypes/Radiotherapy/Generalinformation/Whatisit.aspx')">destroying mutated cells</span>. Although normal cells can sometimes be damaged through this practice, they can typically repair themselves. 
										<br />
										<br />
										<span class = "slight_header">Metastasis</span> - The spread of cancer from the point of origin of the disease <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/treatment/understandingyourdiagnosis/advancedcancer/advanced-cancer-what-is-metastatic')">to another location in the body</span>. The cancer is often much harder to contain once metastasis has occured. 
										
										<br />
										<br />
										<span class = "slight_header">Remission</span> - A cancer patient is in remission when cancer symptoms disapear or are reduced. This is referred to as partial remission and complete remission respectively. 
										
										
										<br />

											Cancer is one of the most prominent diseases in our world today. <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en/')">Fourteen million new cases</span> of cancer are diagnosed each year, with well over <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en/')">eight million of those cases</span> resulting in death. In fact, someone died from cancer in the time it took for you to read this sentence.

                                            <br />
											While cancer may seem entirely random in who it strikes, there are some patterns which may someday guide us towards reducing the occurance rate of the disease. For instance, <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/content/@epidemiologysurveilance/documents/document/acspc-027766.pdf')">around 78 percent of all cancer cases</span> in economically developed countries are in people over the age of 55.

									<dt><a href="#memes" class="accordionTitle2" style = "background-color:#8258FA;">What does 5-year survival mean?</a></dt>
									<dd class="accordionItem2 accordionItemCollapsed2">
										<p>
											The 5-year survival rate is a tool that doctors use to gauge how deadly a particular varient of cancer is. For instance, the <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/lung/cancer-survival-prognosis')">5-year survival rate for lung cancer is 16 percent</span>. This means that 16 out of every 100 people survive 5 years or more after being diagnosed with their illness. This does not mean that the chances for survival for any particular individual are 16 percent: each case is different, and it is important to avoid applying blanket statistics such as these to indidual cases. 
													
											<br />
											<br />
											Surviving 5 years is an indication to many that the treatment has been effective and recovery is an option. One common misconception is that 5-year survival means that it is impossible for these patients to survive past 5 years. <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/lung/cancer-survival-prognosis')">This is not true</span> - many cancer patients go on to lead happy, healthy, and full lives. 5-year survival rates are just that: a number. It is important for patients to not take too much stock in it and instead focus on their own individual case.

There exist countless ways to fight cancer, many of which can be accessed without spending a single cent.

											To start, all of the options outlined in <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('donate.html')">our donation page</span> are excellent ways of donating to specific forms of cancer. These charities allow people to support the forms of cancer that have been the most impactful in their lives. 
											
											
											<br />
											<br />
											However, it is an equally worthy cause to donate to cancer research in general. This can be achieved by donating to organizations such as <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/support-us/donate/donate-money')">Cancer Research UK</span>, who promote and fund life saving research that has changed the face of cancer treatment in years past.

The F Cancer project enables skilled individuals to donate their talents by the hour to various charities, allowing them to gain experience while also furthering the work of charities.
