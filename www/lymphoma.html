There are 2 main types of Lymphoma: <span onClick = "window.open('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma')" class = "link">Hodgkin's Disease</span>, and <span onClick = "window.open('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hodgkin_lymphoma')" class = "link">Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</span>. These 2 forms of Lymphoma will be discussed in great detail below.
						
						
						
						<br />
						<br />
						
                        Since Lymphoma affects the lymphatic system, it directly harms the immune system. Lymphatic cells are a type of white blood cell, which attack pathogens, or bacteria and viruses, the moment they enter the body. Once these white blood cells are rendered useless through Lymphoma, the body is not able to fend off small viruses like the common cold, and patients become sick very often.
						
						<br />
						<br />
						
                        Let's start off by discussing each individual type of Lymphoma. As shown through the graph below, Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma(NHL) is much more common than Hodgkin's Disease. <span onClick = "window.open('http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=79261')" class = "link">NHL is the 6th most common cancer in men, and 5th most common in women</span> as of 2014, in contrast to Hodgkin's Disease, which only <span onClick = "window.open('http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=79261')" class = "link">accounts for 1% of all cancers</span> in the US.

                                            NHL is the more common form of lymphoma, and is actually the 6th most common form of cancer in men, and 5th in women, posing a serious problem to everyone. NHL is essentially the uncontrollable growth of a specific type of cell called a <span onClick = "window.open('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte')" class = "link">lymphocyte</span>.

                                            Lympphocytes can be broken up into two types of cells, B-Cells and T-Cells. <span onClick = "window.open('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell')" class = "link">B-Cells</span> make antibodies, and fight against common germs like bacteria and viruses. These B-Cells use the antibodies they create to latch onto germs and mark them to be destroyed by T-Cells. <span onClick = "window.open('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell')" class = "link">T-Cells</span> perform the actual destruction of harmful germs by digesting germs or boosting the performance of other T-Cells by secreting chemicals. NHL renders these types of cells useless, opening the body up to more attacks, and becoming weaker in defending them at the same time.

Symptoms may include <span onClick = "window.open('http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/non-hodgkins-lymphoma/basics/symptoms/con-20027792?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=abstract&utm_content=Non-Hodgkin-lymphoma&utm_campaign=Knowledge-panel')" class = "link">swollen lymph nodes, severe pain in the joints, chest, or abdomen, whole body fatigue, and many more</span>.

                                            Hodgkin's Disease(HD) attacks the same areas that NHL does: Lymphocytes. HD takes over these cells found in the immune system, and renders them weakend or useless, making the body more prone to sicknesses. Because of this, the symptoms for HD are very similar to NHL. There is one key difference however, which can only be seen under a microscope.

                                            The real difference between NHL and HD is the <i>type</i> of lymphocyte affected. Under close scrutiny of a doctor's microscope, one can tell the difference between NHL and HD if the lymphocyte affected is a <span onClick = "window.open('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed–Sternberg_cell')" class = "link">Reed - Sternberg Cell</span>. RS cells are very large compared to other types of cells, and are typically considered to be a sub set of B-Cells, performing functions much slower and less efficiently. If there are multitudes of thise type of cell in the lymphatic system, it is a clear sign of HD.

                           Even though the death rate of lymphoma has significantly dropped, it still takes away upwards of 10,000 people every year. The incidence rate has shown no sign of letting up, causing pain for thousands of people worldwide every year. Through some of the organizations below, you can help the world get one step closer to relieveing not only current patients in pain, but prevent this problem from ever reoccurring in the future, something that is priceless to humanity. Check out these reputable organizations and take a step forward for the fight against Lymphoma today!
