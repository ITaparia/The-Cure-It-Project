						<span onClick = "window.open('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma')" class = "link">Lymphoma</span> is classified as the uncontrollable growth of a specific type of white blood cell called a <span onClick = "window.open('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphatic_system')" class = "link">lymphatic cell</span>. It is a variant of Blood Cancer, but possesses enough unique properties to warrant individual analysis. There are 2 main types of Lymphatic Cancers: <span onClick = "window.open('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma')" class = "link">Hodgkin's Disease</span>, and <span onClick = "window.open('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hodgkin_lymphoma')" class = "link">Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma</span>. The specifics of both of these will be dissected in great detail down below. 
						
						
						
						<br />
						<br />
						
						Because Lymphoma affects the lymphatic system, it <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/146136.php')">poses a direct threat to the immune system</span>. This is because lymphatic cells are a type of white blood cell. When functioning properly, these cells usually attack pathogens, bacteria, and viruses the moment they enter the body. Once these white blood cells are mutated through Lymphatic Cancers, the body begins to have difficulty fighting off even small viruses like mild colds. This has the effect of turing mild conditions into severe medical crises.
					
						
						<br />
						<br />
						
						Let's start off by discussing each individual form of Lymphatic Cancers. As can be seen through the chart below, Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (sometimes referred to as NHL) is far more common than Hodgkin's Disease. In fact, Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma is <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/content/@editorial/documents/document/acspc-044552.pdf')">the 6th most prominent form of cancer in men, and the 5th most common in women</span> as of 2014. This forms a stark contrast with the other form of Lymphatic Cancer, as Hodgkin's Diseaes <span onClick = "window.open('http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=79261')" class = "link">accounts for only 1% of all cancers</span> in the United States.

											Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma is the most common form of Lymphatic Cancers, with <span class= "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.rtanswers.org/treatmentinformation/cancertypes/lymphomas/facts/')">around 8 cases documented for every one cases of Hodgkin's Disease</span>. It is <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/content/@editorial/documents/document/acspc-044552.pdf')">the 6th most common form of cancer in men, and the 5th most common cancer in women</span>, thus posing a serious threat to everybody. Perhaps the most troubling fact is that the prominence of this disease has been persistently growing since the early 1970's, with <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.lymphoma.org/site/pp.asp?c=bkLTKaOQLmK8E&b=6292453')">an 83 percent increase being observed in the quarter-century following 1973</span>.

                                                <br />
                                             
												Compounding its high prominence rate is the relatively low survival rates that patients who contract the disease experience. In fact, <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.lymphoma.org/site/pp.asp?c=bkLTKaOQLmK8E&b=6292453')">only 63 percent of patients survived more than 5 years</span> after their original diagnosis. The statistics prove to be even more severe for high risk patients, with <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/non-hodgkinlymphoma/detailedguide/non-hodgkin-lymphoma-factors-prognosis')">only 53 percent of such patients</span> surviving beyond this same milestone.

												Additional dangers of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma come from the fact that it can spread around the body fairly easily due to its tendancy to take over blood cells and that it is sometimes very difficult to discover early. The symptoms of the disease, while relatively noticable, are often mistaken as being something less severe due to their nonspecific nature. They may include: <span onClick = "window.open('http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/non-hodgkins-lymphoma/basics/symptoms/con-20027792?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=abstract&utm_content=Non-Hodgkin-lymphoma&utm_campaign=Knowledge-panel')" class = "link">swollen lymph nodes, severe pain in the joints, chest, or abdomen, and whole body fatigue</span>.

											Hodgkin's Disease (sometimes referred to as HD) attacks the same area that Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma does: the lymphocytes. Hodgkin's Disease takes over these cells, and in doing so weakens the immune system. This has the adverse effect of making the body more prone to sickness. Because of this, the symptoms of Hodgkin's Disease are very similar to Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. 
											
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
											One of the most important factors in ensuring that Hodgkin's Disease is dealt with effectively is the stage at which the cancer is discovered. This can be seen through analyzing the <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/hodgkindisease/detailedguide/hodgkin-disease-survival-rates')">relative survival rates by stage</span> that those who contract the disease have historically faced. While the prognosis for the first 2 stages is relatively positve, <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/hodgkindisease/detailedguide/hodgkin-disease-survival-rates')">with 90 percent of patients surviving 5 years or more, only 65 percent of patients whose cancer was discovered in stage IV</span> achieved this same milestone.

These successes have been seen even as the occurance of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma - by far the most common form of Lymphatic Cancer - has skyrocketed. This fact has largely been attributed to the stunning advancements in science and medical technology that have been seen over the past few decades. The mortality rates for the primary forms of Lymphatic Cancer can be seen below.

											The first thing that is done once a patient is diagnosed with any form of Lymphatic Cancer is the establishment of a medical team that is specifically suited to meet the needs of that specific patient. The <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/cancer-basics/cancer-care-team/types-oncologists')">oncologist</span> is a general cancer doctor that establishes the optimal treatment roadmap for the patient. The <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=46290')">medical oncologist</span> specializes in treating cancer with chemotherapy and various chemicals that have been proven to supress cancerous cells. Lastly, the <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.healthcommunities.com/pregnancy/what-is-obgyn.shtml')">Hematology pathologist</span> is a doctor who focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of blood diseases such as Lymphoma. 
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
											While treatment options can vary based on the type and stage of the cancer, treatment options for Lymphatic Cancers typically include:  <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/non-hodgkinlymphoma/detailedguide/non-hodgkin-lymphoma-treating-general-info')">Chemotherapy, Immunotherapy, and certain forms of Targeted Therapy</span>. Sometimes, more than one type of treatment might be used in combination to better suppress the disease. When choosing which treatment plan is best for the patient, some important factors to consider include: the location and stage of the cancer, the patient's overall health, the chances of curing the disease, and the possible impact of the treatment on the blood and lymphatic system.

											In its most basic form, immunotherapy is the practice of <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/treatmenttypes/immunotherapy/immunotherapy-toc')">applying the immune system</span> to combat the development and spread of cancerous cells. While such therapies have existed for some time now, recent developments have made this form of treatment significantly more effective and comfortable for the patient when applied against Lymphatic Cancers.   
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
											One such development has been the further application of vaccines to better help the immune system respond to the presence of cancerous cells. An example of this can be seen through Dendritic cell vaccines. It has been <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/treatmenttypes/immunotherapy/immunotherapy-whats-new-immuno-res')">noted as the most successful attempt at utilizing vaccines as a means of combating cancer</span> thus far, and works by helping the immune system to recognize cancerous cells. This allows the body to tell the difference between healthy cells and cells that need to be destroyed, and in doing so enables the patient to better combat cancerous cells without the extended application of harmful drugs.  
                                            <br />
                                            <br />
                                            
											However, there do exist flaws in the practical application of such medical technologies. For instance, many patients that are <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/treatmenttypes/immunotherapy/immunotherapy-whats-new-immuno-res')">treated with such vaccines fail to respond</span> in a meaningful manner. As with all emerging technologies, the process for undergoing them is <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/treatmenttypes/immunotherapy/immunotherapy-whats-new-immuno-res')">incredibly complex and expensive</span>, something that has limited their application significantly. That said, medical professionals remain hopeful that further research will produce results that are able to assist increasingly large amounts of people.

Although it is a treatment option that has historically been associated with negative side effects and inconsistent results, recent developments have sought to upset that understanding through the careful refinement of the practice. 
											
											
											
										<br />
										<br />
										
											There exist many new chemotherapy drugs that are currently being studied in clinical trials. One such drug, Bendamustine, has proven to be <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/13/8/1285.full')">effective against particularly aggressive cases of Lymphoma</span>. Although negative side effects were observed in several patients, developments such as this stand as a towering example of scientific advancements giving hope to people who otherwise have none. It is believed that additional research can further refine these emerging technologies through the means of making them a more effective and safe option for patients around the world.
