						Oral Cancer is a disease in which a group of oral cells begins to divide uncontrollably, resulting in a tumorous mass. The term "Oral Cancer" <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mouth-cancer/basics/definition/con-20026516')">can refer to</span> cancers of the lips, cheeks, mouth, tounge, throat, as well as related reigons. There are a <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancercenter.com/oral-cancer/types/')">few different types of Oral Cancers</span>, and advanced knowledge of each of these is essential in terms of gaining an appreciation for the situation that Oral Cancer victims struggle with everyday. The three that we will be analyzing later in this page are Squamous Cell Carcinomas, Verrucous Carcinomas, and Salivary Gland Carcinomas.
						
                        
    <br />
    <br />  
	
                        
					Oral Cancers are sometimes difficult to detect due to the relatively unfrightening way in which the symptoms present themselves. While the symptoms are often quite visual, with bleeding sores and speckled white patches in the mouth, many fail to interpret them as being as serious as they actually are. This harm, at least in part, is provided by a lack of understanding for the issue of Oral Cancers. In fact, <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.mouthcancer.org/facts-figures/')">over 10 percent of the United States population</span> is completely unaware that of the threat of Oral Cancers. 
									
					 	<br />
					    <br />
						
						It is now time to look more closely at each type of Oral Cancer in an effort to better understand their impact on the world around us. Below is a chart that details the composition of the various forms of Oral Cancers, something which allows us to isolate the harms of each individual varient and their resulting impacts on society. Worth noting is that about <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancercenter.com/oral-cancer/types/')">90 percent of all Oral Cancer cases</span> are diagnosed as being Squamous Cell Carcinomas.

										<p>
											Your throat and parts of your mouth are covered with many flat squamous cells. Contracting Squamous Cell Carcinoma means that some of these cells have become abnormal and are now actively fighting against the body. Squamous Cell Carcinomas are a relatively pervasive problem, with <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/ear_nose_and_throat_disorders/tumors_of_the_head_and_neck/oral_squamous_cell_carcinoma.html')">over 30,000 people</span> being effected by it each year in the United States alone. This means that Oral Squamous Cell Carcinomas account for 2.5 percent of all cancer cases in the United States. 
											
											<br />
											<br />
											Perhaps the most tragic thing about Squamous Cell Carcinomas is how preventable they can often be. In fact, the single largest risk factor that has been identified for this form of cancer is active engagement in <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21211041')">smoking and the consumption of alchohol</span>. Less preventable is the role that age plays in the prominence of the disease, with the majority of Squamous Cell Carcinoma victims being <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.oralcancerfoundation.org/facts/')">above the age of 40</span>. However, refusing to partake in active smoking and drinking can play a tremendous role in decreasing the likelihood of ever having to endure a case of Squamous Cell Carcinoma. 
											
											
											
											<br />
											<br />
											The lethality of this form of cancer <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/ear_nose_and_throat_disorders/tumors_of_the_head_and_neck/oral_squamous_cell_carcinoma.html')">depends heavily on the location</span> in which it is first contracted. For instance, Squamous Cell Carcinomas that develop on the tounge or the floor of the mouth can have a 5 year survial rate as low as 50 percent, with an additional possibility of spreading to other parts of the body. Carcinomas that appear on the lower lip, however, typically have a much higher survival rate, with 9 out of every 10 people surviving 5 years of more.

									<dt><a class="accordionTitle" href="#" style = "background-color: #F7464A">Verrucous Carcinomas</a></dt>
									<dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
										<p>
											Verrucous Carcinomas are a relatively rare varient of Squamous Cell Carcinomas, <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancercenter.com/oral-cancer/types/')">accounting for around 5 percent</span> of all oral cavity cancers. It is typically very slow growing, which means that it rarely spreads to other parts of the body. However, it can become deeply infused with the oral cavity, something which sometimes results in the degredation of the jaw bone or similar features. 
											
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
											Early treatment is important with this form of cancer, as Verrucous Carcinomas can sometimes spawn cases of Squamous Cell Carcinomas. These Squamous Cell Carcinoma cells <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/oralcavityandoropharyngealcancer/detailedguide/oral-cavity-and-oropharyngeal-cancer-what-is-oral-cavity-cancer')">are not constrained</span> by the slow-moving nature of Verrucous Carcinomas, and as such have the ability to spread to other parts of the body. This means that the danger of Verrucous Carcinomas has the potential to increase significantly over time, turning a very treatable condition into one that can sometimes spiral out of control. 
											
											<br />
											<br />
											Verrucous Carcinomas are especially common males above the age of 60 years old. However, it is occurring in young people more and more due to a recent willingness to partake in chewing tobacco or using snuff orally. Both of these things increase the risk of contracting this cancer so much that it is sometimes referred to as <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verrucous_carcinoma')">"Snuff dipper's cancer"</span>.

										<p>
											Your salivary glands are <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.entnet.org/content/salivary-glands')">responsible for creating saliva</span>, a lubricating substance involved in the early process of digesting food. Salivary Gland Carcinomas are classified when abnormal cells begin to disrupt this bodily function. They are relatively uncommon, only accounting for <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/194522-overview')">about 3 percent</span> of head and neck tumors. 
											
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
											Luckily, the prognosis for those who contract this form of cancer is usually fairly positive, with <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/salivaryglandcancer/detailedguide/salivary-gland-cancer-what-is-key-statistics')">around 72 percent of people</span> diagnosed with Salivary Gland Carcinomas surviving 5 years or more. Even so, more research is necessary to identify new treatment procedures that could improve these odds even further. 
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
											The largest currently identified risk factor associated with Salivary Gland Carcinomas is <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/salivaryglandcancer/detailedguide/salivary-gland-cancer-risk-factors')">age and gender</span>, as the chance of contracting this disease is highest in males past the age of 50. That said, there do exist some other proposed conditions that some studies have suggested may increase the risk of a particular individual contracting a Salivary Gland Carcinoma. A diet low in vegetables and high in animal fat, for instance, has been proposed as one such condition.

						The past two decades have unveiled massive technological advancements that have revolutionized the way we understand and treat Oral Cancers. Despite this, there is still much progress to be made before this issue becomes one of the past.

							<div class = "smallest_header" style = "text-decoration:none;">Why are occurance rates going up?</div>
						<br />
						Well, there are a few reasons. As we've already established, a common risk factor for Oral Cancers is aging. Because our population is <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/04/health/who-world-cancer-report/')">growing older on balance</span>, it makes sense that we are seeing an increase in the occurance of Oral Cancers. However, this increase could also be due to a willingness to smoke and consume alcohol among our youth. The <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21211041')">single largest currently identified factor</span> that increases the chance of contracting Squamous Cell Carcinomas - the most common form of Oral Cancer - is participation in these activities.

										<p>
											Chemotherapy has always served as a valuable tool for doctors and patients alike to combat Oral Cancers. However, the side effects that this form of treatment can sometimes have has attached a negative stigma to the practice, something which has made some patients apprehensive to attempting it. Thankfully, recent advancements have brought with them new applications of chemotherapy that are both better suited for targeting cancerous tumors and more comfortable for those that must experience it.
                                            
                                            <br />
                                            <br />
											One recent approach involves injecting the chemotherapy drug directly into the tumor. While in the past this approach sometimes led to the drug quickly spreading throughout the body, recent advancements have made it possible to prepare the chemotherapy drugs <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/oralcavityandoropharyngealcancer/detailedguide/oral-cavity-and-oropharyngeal-cancer-new-research')">so that they remain in the tumor</span>, thus ensuring a more comfortable and active treatment. 
											<br />
											<br />
                                            
                                           	Additionally, chemotherapy for Oral Cancers is sometimes used as a <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/mouth-cancer/treatment/chemotherapy/about-chemotherapy-for-mouth-cancer')">supplement to other treatments</span>, ultimately aiming to shrink the tumor before surgery or radiotherapy. This means we are sometimes able to slowly ween off our dependance on chemotherapy and the many harms that have historically come along with it.

											Recent discoveries have done much to better our understanding regarding the actual causes of Oral Cancers, something that has given people everywhere the opportunity to protect themselves from this terrible disease. This means that it is now possible for everyone to take significant steps towards ensuring a healthier, safer life free from the burden of cancer. 
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
											The facts are alarming in their clarity: <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancercenter.com/oral-cancer/risk-factors/')">about 80 percent</span> of the people who contract cancers of the Oral Cavity and related reigons participate in the usage of tobacco, be it through cigarettes, chewing tobacco or snuff. Additionally, around 70 percent of people who are diagnosed with Oral Cancer are relatively heavier drinkers. Current projections indicate that smoking and drinking can <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancercenter.com/oral-cancer/risk-factors/')">do so much as double</span> a particular individual's chance of contracting a form of Oral Cancer.

                                            It is through discoveries such as these that we can all be given the ability to advance the fight against cancer, one decision at a time. Information stands alone as the sole thing that possesses the ability to empower people to make healthy choices about what they choose to do and not do. And after all, one of the best ways to combat cancer is through prevention.
