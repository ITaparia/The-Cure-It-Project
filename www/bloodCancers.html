						Blood Cancers are diseases in which normal blood cell development is disturbed by the unchecked growth of a varient on an ordinary blood cell. There are 3 primary forms of Blood Cancer: Leukemia, Lymphoma, and Myeloma. We will get into the specifics of each in just a moment. First, let us take a moment to 
						acknowledge the problem as it currently exists.
					
						<br />
						<br />
						
						Blood Cancers are among the more promient types of Cancer, accounting for nearly <a target="_blank" href = "http://www.lls.org/diseaseinformation/getinformationsupport/factsstatistics/" class = "link" target="_blank">10 percent of the deaths associated with Cancer in 2014</a>. To provide a sense of context for these figures, consider the fact
						that someone in the United States is diagnosed with a blood Cancer every 4 minutes, and that deaths from Blood Cancer occur approximately once every 10 minutes. 
						<br />
						<br />
						Let us now delve into
						the specifics of each varient of Blood Cancer in an effort to better understand their significance. Below is a chart that specifies the estimated percentage of occurance between the 3
						primary forms of Blood Cancer.

										<p>
											Leukemia is a form of Cancer that begins in the tissue that generates blood for the body. Leukemia turns a person's bone marrow against them, altering it to produce
						abnormal white blood cells. These cells are called Leukemia cells, and their presence makes it challenging for normal blood cells to function properly. This lack of 
						proper functioning is where many of the health harms of Leukemia come from. 
						
						<br />
						<br />
						
						In order to grasp a thorough understanding of what living with Leukemia entails, we must first analyze the symptoms that spawn from it. Early identification of these 
						symptoms is essential in terms of ensuring that the problem is dealt with effectively. While none of these symptoms are cause for significant alarm when isolated, the accumulation 
						of many of them can be indiciative of the early stages of Leukemia. 
						
						<br />
						<br />
						
						To provide a non-exhaustive list, symptoms include: <span onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancercenter.com/leukemia/symptoms/')"class = "link">fatigue, fevers, chills, cold sweats, frequent infections,
						easy bruising, and weight loss</span>. These symptoms can make everyday tasks such as walking around or enjoying a meal incredibly difficult to accomplish, especially when one factors in the
						side-effects that treatement may have on an individual. 
						
						
						<br />
						<br />
						
						Due to the slow-moving nature of Leukemia, many do not register the symptoms as being significant right away. This means that they do not interpret these symptoms as being cancerous, 
						which can lead to dangerous consequences in the long term. With every passing day comes another opportunity for the person's body to generate more dangerous white blood cells. As a result
						of this, an additional danger of Leukemia lies within its tendancy to remain undiscovered until after the body has produced enough cells to disturb the natural balance of white and red 
						blood cells.  </p>
									</dd>
									
									<dt><a class="accordionTitle" href="#" style = "background-color: #F7464A">Myeloma</a></dt>
									<dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
										<p>
										Myeloma is a cancer of the plasma cells in bone marrow. Individuals with this disease suffer from a disorderly production of unhealthy plasma cells that fill up the bone marrow, thus
						disrupting the production of normal blood cells. This, in many cases, leads to an overabundance of plasma cells which damages the bone itself, which results in an excess of pain and 
						potential bone fractures. Myeloma is a fairly common form of blood cancer, as <span onClick = "window.open('http://www.ucsfhealth.org/conditions/multiple_myeloma/')" class = "link"> approximately 60,000 people in the United States currently have the disease</span>, with another 20,000 cases
						being diagnosed each year. 
						
					    <br />
					    <br /> 
						
						While the symptoms of Myeloma may be absent at first, they ultimately develop as plasma cells build up. The relatively lengthy period between contracting the disease and becoming
						disaserously symptomatic is one of the more dangerous aspects of Myeloma, as it means that early diagnosal can often prove to be difficult. 
						
						<br />
						<br />
						
						In adherance to the sometimes difficult nature of identifiying Myeloma, many symptoms of the disease remain dormant until things have progressed to the point of being potentially
						dangerous. These symptoms can involve bone pain, weakness, diziness, bruising, or excessive confusion.

									<dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">

											Lymphoma is a form of Cancer begins in immune calls called lymphocytes. It is a relatively common form of cancer. In fact, an <span onClick = "window.open('http://headstrong.org/blood-cancer/lymphoma/')" 
						class = "link"> estimated 730,000+ individuals in the United States</span> have, or are in remision from, Lymphoma. It specifically targets the immune system, something which often has the
						effect of making the inflicted person
						especially vulnerable to viruses and other external conditions. 
						
						<br />
						<br />
						
						It is sometimes compared to Leukemia in that it also results from issues with white blood cells. However, the symptoms of Lymphoma are often more visible than Leukemia. For instance, 
						Lymphoma is often associated with swollen lymph nodes in the armpits, neck, or groin of an individual. It can also result in chest pain, coughing, difficulties with breathing, sweats, and
						rapid weight loss. 
						
						<br />
						<br />
						
						Due to the physical nature of many Lymphoma symptoms, the potential for early identification of the disease is greater when compared with Leukemia. Early identification tests performed
						by a doctor involve the stimulation of lymph nodes and tests to verfify if they are swollen. While swollen lymph nodes are often indicative of infections, such findings will often 
						prompt further investigations which can lead to the early identification of Lymphoma, something that is essential in terms of ensuring the option of pursuing aggressive treatement.

						New technological advancements have proven to be very effective in terms of treating Blood Cancer patients. Take Leukemia for example - as can be seen below, the general trends that dictate the deaths resulting from this type of cancer have generally been positive.	In fact, the 5-year cancer survival rate increased by a <a href = "http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/leuks.html" class = "link" target="_blank">whopping 26 percent between 1975 and 2005</a>.

						<div class = "smallest_header" style = "text-decoration:none;">Why the decrease?</div>

						Well, there are a few reasons. Beyond the relentless march of medicinal improvements, this decrease in death rates can further be attributed to exciting new research present in the field. We will highlight a few examples of these innovative discoveries below in an attempt to drive up exposure for those attempting to make a positive change.

									<dd class="accordionItem2 accordionItemCollapsed2">
										<p>This is a field that has, even in just the past two years, exploded with activity. These types of improvements allow doctors to "teach" a patient's cells to seek out and destroy cancerous cells. This can act as a welcome supplement to more aggressive forms of treatment, as it provides another avenue upon which cancer can be attacked, thus resulting in the long term safety and security of patients that may have struggled in the past.

											A 2014 study titled <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://m.stm.sciencemag.org/content/6/224/224ra25.abstract')">
												
												Efficacy and Toxicity Management if 19-28z CAR T Cell Therapy in B Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</span> unveiled some of the improvments that have been made in this field over the past few years. The study built on 
											information gathered in the original 2013 analysis and experimented with innovative new methods of treatment, taking care to specifically discover and detail alternatives to stem cell transplants. Their findings were incredibly encouraging, with 88 percent of the involved patients responding positively to the treatment. All of the most common side effects, while unpleasant, were ultimately completely treatable and did not affect the patients in the long term. 
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
											Additionally, a study titled <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1407222?query=featured_home')">Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells for Sustained Remissions in Leukemia</span> attempted to reprogram blood cells to seek out and destroy cancerous cells before infusing back into the general bloodstream. The treatment led to complete remissions in 90 percent of the patients involved. All of these patients had failed to respond to conventional treatments, and some had relapsed several times before. This treatment, for many of the patients, was the only source of hope that they had encountered in years. While unintended side effects hampered some patients, the scientists remain optimistic that these early difficulties can and will be resolved. In fact, lead researcher <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p2328')">Carl June</span> suggests that the versatile methods used in the study could prove valuable in treating other forms of cancer, such as cancer of the pancreas or lungs.

									<dd class="accordionItem2 accordionItemCollapsed2">
										<p>Chemotherapy is, simply put, the use of drugs to eliminate dangerous cancer cells. A negative stigma has been attached to Chemotherapy in years past due to the harmful side effects that this type of treatement has been known to sometimes generate. However, recent years have brought with them innovations that have made these drugs not only more comfortable to experience, but also more effective in targeting the specific cells that must be removed from the body.
											
										<br />	
										<br />	
											
											Modern Chemotherapy drugs have been engineered to attack specific targets on cancer cells in an effort to increase effectiveness while minimizing adverse health effects. To do this, doctors attach special proteins to the drugs which allow them to be guided directly to the cancer cells. This means that the chemotherapy drugs are more effective in striking at the root of the problem whilst also decreasing the number of non-cancer cells effected. 
											
										<br />
										<br />
										
											One of the most innovative improvements to Chemotherapy has been achieved through the use of a technique in which the drug is packaged inside a liposome. This allows the drug to actively degraded specifically in the tumor tissue, thus minimising the risk of side effects such as nausea and hair loss.
