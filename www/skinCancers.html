                        Skin Cancer is a disease in which a group of Skin Cells begins dividing uncontrollably due to a series of mutations and genetic defects, thus resulting in cancerous tumors. All Skin Cancers can be grouped into several primary categories. For the sake of education, we will simplify these categories into three main groups: Melanoma, Basal Cell Cardinoma, and Squamous Cell Carinoma. Basal Cell Cardinoma and Squamous Cell Carinoma have many similarities, and as such are sometimes referred to as <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nonmelanoma-skin-cancer/basics/definition/con-20036452')">non-melanoma skin cancers</span>. 
                        
                        
    <br />
    <br />  
                        
                        
                        Skin Cancer is extraordinarily far-reaching in its impacts in that it is the most common of all currently existing cancers. In fact, Skin Cancer accounts for <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('https://www.photocure.com/Specialty-areas/Skin-cancer/')">nearly half of all cancer cases in the United States</span>. Because these numbers are so inclusive, everyone is potentially at risk for the development of Skin Cancer. That said, there do exist <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/skin-cancer/basics/risk-factors/con-20031606')">several external factors</span> that can result in a higher risk for contracting this terrible disease. These include: A family history of Skin Cancer, pale skin, unprotected exposure, and a weakened immune system.

						Let us now take a closer look at each varient of Skin Cancer in an attempt to better grasp their significance. Below is a chart that demonstrates the percentages of deaths within Skin Cancer that result from its most deadly varient: Melanoma. Keep in mind that Melanoma accounts for <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/skin-cancer-facts')">less than 2 percent of all currently diagnosed Skin Cancers</span>, a shocking figure when one considers the number of deaths that they cause. Simply put, while the other forms of Skin Cancer certainly warrant further research, it is Melanoma that claims the vast majority of lives in regards to Skin Cancers.

											Melanoma is a form of cancer that begins in the Melanocytes, the portion of the skin responsible for producing Melanin and controlling skin color. While Melanoma is the most rare form of Skin Cancer, accounting for <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/skin-cancer-facts')">less than 2 percent of all cases diagnosed per year</span>, it is also the most deadly. Although it can almost always be cured if caught in its earlier stages, the aggressive nature of the disease ensures that this window of corrective opportunity remains very small. 
											
											<br />
											<br />
											The issue of Melanoma is a pressing one, especially when once considers that diagnosal rates of this terrible disease have been <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/skincancer-melanoma/overviewguide/melanoma-skin-cancer-overview-key-statistics')">steadily increasing in the United States for over 30 years</span>. In fact, there are currently over <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/melan.html')">960,000 people</span> living with Melanoma Skin Cancer in the United States right now. Additionally worth noting is that while Melanoma can occur in both younger and older people, the risk of contracting this disease increase with age. 
											
											
											
											<br />

                                            One major difficulty with achieving an early treatement of Melanoma is the degree to which it can remain dormant for long periods of time. One way that this can happen is in the form of a skin mole. While the vast majority of moles will never turn into anything harmful, some still do, and it is this casual gap that researches are trying to close in the hopes that it will save lives through the early discovery of this disease.

											Basal Cell Cardinoma is a form of Skin Cancer in which an uncontrolled growth develops in the skin's basal cells. It is the <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000824.htm')">most common form of cancer in the United States</span>. Thankfully, Basal Cell Cardinomas are nearly always a relatively unaggressive form of Skin Cancer and typically do not spread beyond the original tumor site. However, Basal Cell Cardinoma Skin Cancer that is left untreated can result in severe disfigurement.

						Recent technological developments have proven to be incredibly effective in terms of bettering our understanding of Skin Cancers. However, we still have a long way to go before this terrible disease can accurately be considered a non-issue. In adherance to this idea, we will highlight some of the successes that have been made in the field over the past few years in an effort to underscore the tremendous advancements that are saving lives and striking the issue of Skin Cancer at its source.

                          Much of this increase can be explained by the <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/04/health/who-world-cancer-report/')">simple fact that our population is aging</span>. Because the risk of contracting a form of Skin Cancer <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/types/skin/incidence/uk-skin-cancer-incidence-statistics#age')">increases with age</span>, a larger portion of our population is susceptible to the disease, thus explaining the increase in occurance rates. As can be seen below, steps are being taken to mitigate this risk through the use of advanced technologies and an increase understanding of how to avoid contracting Skin Cancer in the first place.

												The aggressive nature of Melanoma Skin Cancer means that the likelihood of it responding positively to chemotherapy treatements is often quite low. While it can sometimes shrink tumors by as much as 15 percent, this is usually not enough to improve the survival rate of the patient as a whole. Thankfully, the emergence of new drugs such as <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vemurafenib')">Vemurafenib</span> and <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipilimumab')">Ipilimumab</span> have the potential to transform Skin Cancer treatements as we know them, giving hope to patients that have otherwise exhausted all other options.

											There exists within about <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://magazine.uclahealth.org/body.cfm?id=6&action=detail&ref=941')">50 percent of Melanomas</span> a gene called BRAF that assists in cell growth. A <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/82344-102')">Phase III clinical trial</span> analyzed the impact of Vemurafenib targeting the BRAF gene and the resulting effect that this had on overall survival rates.

The results were extremely encouraging, with a whopping 8.6 percent increase in three-year survival rates when compared to those that did not recieve Ipilimumab. The impact of this study becomes even more significant when one considers that <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.oncolink.org/conferences/article.cfm?id=6646')">the trial</span> included over 500 patients with Melanoma that could not be surgically removed, thus presenting them with life-saving options that did not exist in years past.

                                           It has been discovered that nearly all cases of Skin Cancer <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/skincancer-melanoma/detailedguide/melanoma-skin-cancer-new-research'")>can be prevented</span> long before they become life threatening. This is due to the visible nature of the disease, as it often makes itself present in the form of visible sores and harsh rashes. It is for this reason that there has been a recent movement to promote public education regarding these terrible cancers, as increased awareness will undoubtably save lives as people learn to check themselves for signs of Skin Cancer and take steps to prevent themselves from ever contracting it in the first place.

											Physicians have recently developed a simple system that will hopefully aid in the early detection of Melanoma, the deadliest form of Skin Cancer. Called the <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/melanoma/melanoma-warning-signs-and-images/do-you-know-your-abcdes')">ABCDE system</span>, it involves the self-examination of moles for visible features that are consistent with what one would find in a case of Melanoma. This allows people to sort the normal from the irregular, and will hopefully assist in the protection of people against the threat of developing Skin Cancers.
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
											
											
											Additionally, the increased understanding of the causes of Skin Cancer has afforded people the opportunity to take steps to prevent themselves from contracting Skin Cancer in the first place. For instance, the discovery of the role of UV rays in the development of Skin Cancer has prompted a movement to educate people on the harms of these rays, and the <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/sunanduvexposure/skincancerpreventionandearlydetection/skin-cancer-prevention-and-early-detection-u-v-protection')">reasonable steps</span> that they can take to avoid them.
