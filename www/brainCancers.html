                        Brain Cancer is a disease in which a group of cancerous cells begin developing in a person's brain tissue. This can have massive implications on the functioning of typical brain operations such as muscle control, sensation, and memory development. All Brain Cancers fall into two primary categories: Primary and Secondary. However, there do exist other classifications of this deadly disease, such as Meningiomas and Glioblastomas. All of these terms are covered in greater detail down below.
                        
						<br />
						<br />
                        The impacts of Brain Cancer are everywhere. In fact, <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.abta.org/about-us/news/brain-tumor-statistics/')">nearly 700,000 people</span> in the United States are currently living with Brain Cancer, with over <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.abta.org/about-us/news/brain-tumor-statistics/')"> 191 cases being discovered</span> each and every day worldwide. While the threat of Brain Cancer can impact anyone, it is statistically more common in younger children and older adults. In fact, Brain Cancer accounts for <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://health.usnews.com/health-conditions/cancer/brain-tumor/overview')">25 percent of all cancers</span> seen in children. The side effects of Brain Cancer can <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/brain-tumor-adults/prognosis.html')">persist throughout the remainder of a victim's life</span>, thus necessitating further research to eliminate this unecessary threat. 
                        
                
						<br />
						<br />
                        Let us now delve into the specifics of each varient of Brain Cancer in an effort to better understand their significance. Below is a chart that details the estimated survival rates for those diagnosed with Brain Cancer. As you can see, the issue is quite severe, with just 33 percent of patients surviving the first five years after diagnosal. In fact, the majority of people <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/types/brain/survival/brain-and-central-nervous-system-cancer-survival-statistics')">do not survive even a single year</span> after being diagnosed.

                                            Evaluating whether a Brain Cancer is Primary or Secondary is an essential step in terms of developing an effective treatment plan. A Primary Brain Cancer is one that has started either in the brain or in related structures. A Secondary Brain Cancer is one that began in another part of the body, but spread to the brain after a period of development.

                                            Only about <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://health.usnews.com/health-conditions/cancer/brain-tumor/overview')">20 percent of Brain Cancers are primary</span>. This means that while primary brain tumors only account for around 2 percent of all cancer cases in adults, the reach of Brain Cancer indirectly harms thousands more through secondary brain tumors.

More research is needed in order develop our understanding of not only what causes Brain Cancer, but also the steps that we can take to avoid it.

                                            Meningiomas are, simply put, tumors that arise from the coverings  of the brain and spinal cord. They typically are found on the outer curve and top of the brain. Meningiomas are fairly common, accounting for <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.abta.org/brain-tumor-information/types-of-tumors/meningioma.html')">nearly a third</span> of all Primary Brain Cancers. 
                                            
                                            <br />
                                            <br />
                                            
                                            In order to truly grasp what it is like to live with a Meningioma, one must first consider the symptoms that those suffering from it sometimes experience. While the symptoms vary in relation to the position and size of the tumor in the brain, <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.webmd.com/brain/meningioma-causes-symptoms-treatment')">some common ones</span> include headaches, weakness, and personality changes. 
                                            
                                            
                                      
											<br />
											<br />
											
										One major issue with the discovery of Meningiomas is the degree to which they can remain dormant for long periods of time, growing silently until they become too late to stop. While they grow relatively slowly, they often reach fairly large sizes before altering the typical functioning of the brain, something which makes early treatment of Meningiomas a challenge.

                                            Glioblastomas are cancerous tumors made up from the supportive tissue of the brain. They are highly dangerous due to their rapid rate of reproduction and their tendancy to invade other portions of the brain before action can be taken. In fact, around <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.irsa.org/glioblastoma.html')">13,000 people die</span> of these brain tumors each and every year in the United States alone. 
                                            
                        
									
										<br />
										<br />
										
										The symptoms of Glioblastomas may on the surface seem fairly similar to those of Meningiomas. They include: memory loss, nausea, headaches, and alterations in personality. However, because the cancerous cells come from normal brain cells, it is easy for them to invade healthy brain tissue. This accelerates the timetable of the cancer, making it easier to discover whilst also making it more dangerous to contract. 

                                            
                                            <br />
                                            <br />
                                            Over 90 percent of Glioblastomas fall within the category of Primary Brain Cancers. These form very quickly and are very agressive, leading to symptoms that at times can seem crippling. This combined with the fairly common nature of this type of Brain Cancer may explain why the majority of people who contract Primary Brain Cancer <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/types/brain/survival/brain-and-central-nervous-system-cancer-survival-statistics')">do not even survive their first year</span> of being sick.

						   While recent years have seen phenomenal technological advancements that have proven to be very effective in terms of saving lives, Brain Cancer remains a tremendous issue that demands public attention. As can be seen below, the prognosis held after contracting Brain Cancer is certaintly nowhere near acceptable levels. However, we will highlight some advancements that are being made in this field in an effort to increase the exposure levels of those trying to make a positive change and save innocent lives.

                            Before we delve into the specifics of what is being done, we must first realize that the <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/brain-tumour/about/brain-tumour-risks-and-causes')">cause of Brain Cancer is currently unknown</span>. That being said, progress has been made in terms of identifying several risk factors which may increase the likelyhood of a particular individual contracting this terrible disease. As the gears of technological advancement continue to turn, it is hoped that further research will not only clarify the origins of Brain Cancer, but also reveal steps that we can take to combat it.

                                            The use of antiviral drugs has been a treatment method that has bore some success in recent years. For instance, a <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1302145')">2006 clinical trial</span> conducted by <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.zoominfo.com/p/Cecilia-Söderberg-Nauclér/1527581115')">Dr. Cecilia Soderberg-Naucler</span> made use of Valcyte - an antiviral drug usually used to treat viruses in AIDS patients - to combat some of the more aggressive forms of Brain Cancer. 
                                            
                                            <br />
                                            <br />
                                            
                                            The results were shocking, with 70 percent more patients surviving past the two year mark. In fact, the average survival rate for patients recieving this antiviral treatment was three years higher than those only exposed to traditional treatement measures. As Steinbacher, one of the patients recieving this innovative treatement, put it, "I know I am alive today because of Dr. Cobbs."

                                            While the results in this trial are not reason enough to entirely alter current treatment plans, their encouraging findings suggest that the general trends that dictate Brain Cancer research are positive on balance. As <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://doctors.dana-farber.org/directory/profile.asp?pict_id=0500757')">Dr. David Reardon</span>, director of neuro-oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute puts it, "[This is] very exciting data."

                                            One of the most valuable ways to approach an issue as large as Brain Cancer is to experiement with what may seem like crazy ideas. That's exactly what <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://uhealthsystem.com/doctors/profile/133093')">Dr. Ricardo Komotar</span>, chair of the <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.flneurosurg.org')">Florida Neurosurgical Society</span> did with his <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.medtronic.com/for-healthcare-professionals/products-therapies/neurological/laser-ablation/visualase/')">Visualase Thermal Therapy System</span>, a laser based therapy designed to treat advanced forms of Brain Cancer with minimal side effects. 
                                            
                                            <br />

                                            While current applications of the treatment have been limited, the leap in technology is impressive. It utilizes a 3-millimeter laser probe to seek out and essentially cook the cancerous tumor from the inside out without harming healthy brain tissue. The technology as it currently exists is meant for those with Brain Cancers that have advanced to the stage of being considered inoperable or beyond the control of traditional treatments.
