						Eye cancers are tumorous growths found in the ocular region of the head. Eye Cancers have been known to spread to other parts of the body relatively quickly when compared to other diseases, something which makes them difficult to treat effectively. There are three primary types of Eye Cancer: Intraocular Melanomas, Intraocular Lymphomas, and Retinoblastomas. The specifics of each type will be discussed thouroughly down below.
						
						
						
						<br />
						<br />
						
						While Eye Cancers can impact anyone, they are especially prominent in males over the age of 55. Eye Cancers actually account for <a target="_blank" href = "http://www.ocularmelanoma.org/disease.htm" class = "link" target="_blank">anywhere from 5 to 7.5 million unique cases of cancer throughout the US and Europe</a>. To put this in perspective, over 2,500 adults each year in the US alone will be diagnosed with this terrible disease. 
						
						<br />
						<br />
						
						We will now begin walking you through the specifics of Eye Cancer. The graph below reveals the percentage of occurance in relation to each respective subset of Eye Cancer. As you can see, Melanomas are far more common than Lymphomas, and Retinoblastomas are an even rarer form, only found in children.

										<p>
                                            Retinoblastomas are a form of Eye Cancer, found specifically in <span onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/eye-cancer/about/types-of-eye-cancer')"class = "link">children under the age of 5. </span> Retinoblastomas are extremely rare, but a huge problem nonetheless. They are usually contracted as a result of mutation in a specific gene called the Rb gene. In order to understand Retinoblastomas, we must first discuss what it is. A brief overview of eye functions and anatomy shows that the retina is the the part of the eye that takes light from the world around us, and transforms this light into electrical impulses the brain can decode through a process called transduction. Therefore, retinoblastomas are essentially the cancer of the retina.
                                               
                                                <br />
                                                <br />
                                               
                                                When a baby is growing in the womb, the eyes are one of the first things to develop. In the very early stages the eyes have cells called retinoblasts that grow very fast. They later stop growing and develop into mature retinal cells that can detect light. Very rarely the immature retinoblasts continue to grow very fast and do not turn into mature retinal cells. Instead they grow out of control and develop into this cancerous tumour known as retinoblastoma.
                                               
                                                <br />
                                                <br />
                                               
                                            It is of the utmost importance to find this cancer during the pre-natal stage of growth, and prevent it from spreading to other parts of the body after birth. The process of cancer spreading to other body parts is called metastasis. Symptoms of this cancer include: White pupils, constant dilation, blood vessel rupture, and complete loss of eyesight. This occurs in usually one eye, but since this <span onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/eye-cancer/about/types-of-eye-cancer')"class = "link">cancer is inheritable, it might occur in both eyes as a result of genetic mutation.</span>  
          
                                               
                                                <br />
                                                <br />
                                                 
                                    If this tumor isnt treated quickly, the cancerous cells will actually continue to grow, and invade most of the eyeball. This can go through metastatis by spreaing to other parts of the eye, and actually causing eye fluid blockage. This blockage builds up pressure in the eye, and actually results in complete blindness.

                                            Before we talk about Intraocular Melanomas and their impact on a person, lets understand what exactly Melanoma is. <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.news-medical.net/health/Melanin-What-is-Melanin.aspx')">Melanoma is essentially malignant cells rapidly growing from melanin, a pigment in the skin which is responsible for tanning when exposed to the Sun.</span> This is why extreme caution is used when tanning in tanning beds, and why you use sunscreen so much on the beach, because the Sun's powerful UV rays have the potential to damage that melanin pigment severely. Although melanomas are usually on the skin, it can sometimes stem from the eye, resulting in Intraocular Melanoma.
											
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
											Intraocular Melanoma is by far the most common form of Eye Cancer, accounting for over 90% of all Eye Cancers. If melanoma is recognized and treated early, it is almost always curable, but if it is not, the cancer can advance and spread to other parts of the body, where it becomes hard to treat and can be fatal. People inflicted with this terrible disease are often fair skinned, and typically middle aged. 
											
											
											
											
											
											<br />
											<br />
                                            The symptoms of Intraocular Melanomas can be devestating if left unchecked. They range from <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/intraocularmelanoma/Patient/page1')">blurred vision to an actual change in position of the eye in the eye socket. Symptoms also include darkspots on the iris, or a change in shape of the pupil.</span>

                                            Not unlike Intraocular Melanomas, Intraocular Lymphomas are used to describe a broad type of cancer: <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/146136.php')">Lymphoma</span>, but instead occuring in the ocular region. Lymphoma is defined as the uninhibited growth of lymph nodes. Lypmph nodes regulate important parts of the immune system, and are only visible when swollen, indicating a major problem in whatever region of the body it is in, in this case, the eye.
									
										<br />
										<br />
										
										Intraocular Lymphomas, while still dangerous, only account for around 7% of all Eye Cancer cases in the world, very small when compared to Intraocular Melanoma. The diagnosis of intraocular lymphoma is typically made by removal of cells (vitrectomy) from the eye with subsequent cytopathologic evaluation. Once the diagnosis is certain, a hematologist-oncologist should be consulted to perform an evaluation for systemic and central nervous system lymphoma.
										
										<br />
										<br />
										
										There are many symptoms of Intraocular Lymphoma that are quite distinguishable. Noticing and alerting a doctor of these symptoms is an essential step in terms of ensuring a high chance of survival. These symptoms cover many common symptoms of the other 2 types of Eye Cancer, like blurred vision and change in eye pupil shape, but there is also noticable swelling in the face region, as a result of lymph nodes reacting to this deadly infliction.

                            The tremendous strides made in both technology and knowledge have enabled doctors to treat these seemingly bleak diseases effectively and quickly, allowing for higher survival rates than ever seen before, as seen in the graph below. We have seen an increase of survival rates from 68% to 85% from 1975 to the present.

						New technological advancements have proven to be very effective in terms of treating Blood Cancer patients. Take Leukemia for example - as can be seen below, the general trends that dictate the deaths resulting from this type of cancer have generally been positive.	In fact, the 5-year cancer survival rate increased by a <a href = "http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/leuks.html" class = "link" target="_blank">whopping 26 percent between 1975 and 2005</a>.

											When Eye Cancer is diagnosed within an individual, there are many things that happen at once in order to ensure said individual receives the best care possible. First, the patient is assigned a team of special doctors. These doctors include people who specialize in treating diseases of the eye (Ophthalmologists), people who specialize in treating cancers of the eye (Ophthalmologists), people who treat cancer with radiation therapy (Radiation Oncologists), and people who treat cancers with medicines such as chemotherapy (Medical Oncologists).
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
                                            Once a medical team is established, those doctors then work with the patient to develop the best treatment plan for his or her needs. Depending on the type and stage of the cancer and other factors, treatment options for eye cancer can include: <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/eyecancer/detailedguide/eye-cancer-treating-general-info')">Surgery, radiation therapy, laser therapy, chemotherapy, and certain types of targeted therapy.</span> Sometimes, more than one of type of treatment might be used. In choosing which treatment plan is best for the patient, some important factors to consider include the location and stage of the cancer, the patient's overall health, the chances of curing the disease, and the possible impact of the treatment on vision.

									<dt><a class="accordionTitle2" href="#memes" style = "background-color: #F7464A;">Radiation Therapy</a></dt>
									<dd class="accordionItem2 accordionItemCollapsed2">
										<p>
											Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells. It is a common treatment for intraocular melanoma. Radiation therapy can often preserve some vision in the eye, although sometimes this might be lost anyway if the radiation damages other parts of the eye. An advantage over surgery is that the eye structure is preserved, which may result in a better appearance after treatment.
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
                                            Instead of using x-rays as in standard radiation therapy, the <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_beam_radiotherapy')">external beam radiation therapy</span> approach focuses proton beams on the cancer. Protons are positive parts of atoms. Unlike x-rays, which release energy both before and after they hit their target, protons cause little damage to tissues they pass through and then release their energy after traveling a certain distance. 
                                            <br /><br />
                                            This means that proton beam radiation may be able to deliver more radiation to the tumor and do less damage to nearby normal tissues, a huge advancement over previous forms of treatement.

										Surgery is used to treat some intraocular melanomas, but it is used less often than in the past as the use of radiation therapy has grown. Surgery is not used to treat intraocular lymphoma.
										
										<br />
										<br />
										
										During the same operation, an orbital implant is usually put in to take the place of the eyeball. The implant is made out of silicone or hydroxyapatite (a substance similar to bone). It is attached to the muscles that moved the eye, so it should move the same way as the eye would have. 
                                            <br />
                                            <br />
                                            Within a few weeks after surgery, the patient then visits an Ocularist (a specialist in eye prostheses) to be fitted with an artificial eye, a thin shell that fits over the orbital implant and under the eyelids. The artificial eye will match the size and color of the remaining eye. Once it is in place, it will be hard to tell it apart from the real eye.

                           Unfortunately, Eye Cancer remains an underresearched form of cancer that lacks public awareness. While progress has certaintly been made in recent years, further research is required to make this Eye Cancer an issue of the past. Fotunately, the organizations detailed below all provide a valuable opportunity to right this wrong, and to ensure that Eye Cancer is allocated the research that it deserves and requires.
