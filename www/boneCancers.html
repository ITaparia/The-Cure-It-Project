                        <span onClick = "window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_tumor')"class = "link">Bone Cancer</span> is described as the uncontrollable growth of cells, originating in areas with bones or bone related cells. There are 3 different types of Bone Cancers: <span onClick = "window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosarcoma')"class = "link">Osteosarcomas</span>, <span onClick = "window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewing's_sarcoma')"class = "link">Ewing Tumors(ET)</span>, and <span onClick = "window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrosarcoma')"class = "link">Chondrosarcomas</span>. These 3 forms of cancer will be discussed in great detail below.
						
						
						
						<br />
						<br />
						
                        Bone Cancers, as the name implies, are abnormal clusters of cells found inside bones, and lead to the death of normal bone tissue. The real danger in this type of cancer is how easily it can spread, or <span onClick = "window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis')"class = "link">metastasize</span> around the body. Since bones exist in practically every system and area of the body, this disease has the potential to be spread almost anywhere.
						
						<br />
						<br />
						
                        Let's start off by discussing each individual type of bone cancer. As shown through the graph below, Osteosarcomas are easily the most common types of bone cancer, accounting for <span onClick = "window.open('http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=34&ContentID=24884-1')"class = "link">56% of all bone cancer cases</span>. This is followed by Ewing Tumors, and finally, Chondrosarcomas.

                                            Osteosarcomas are the most frequent form of bone cancer, as illustrated by the chart above. Before discussing this form of cancer in detail, it is essential to understand the implications of this cancer in regard to specifically being located in the <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.innerbody.com/image/skelfov.html')">skeletal system</span>. It is pretty apparent to most people what the skeletal system does for the body: protection and support. The only reason why the body is able to move the way it is is due to the joints and bones located all over the body.
                                            
                                                <br />
                                                <br />
                                               
                                            The fact that bones are located everywhere on the body is what makes this form of cancer so dangerous. Osteosarcomas can technically occur anyplace where a bone exists, but <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/bone-cancer/about/types-of-bone-cancer')">most commonly forms near the lower thigh (femur), shin bone (tibia), and the upper arm (humerus).</span> The exact causes of bone cancer are unknown, but it is known that genetics play a key factor in the transmission of this disease.
                                               
                                                <br />

                                            Symptoms of bone cancer vary, depending on the location and size of the tumor. The most common ones include <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/bonecancer/detailedguide/bone-cancer-signs-symptoms')">intense pain at tumor site, rare bone fractures, breathing issues, and unexplained weight loss.</span>

                                            Ewing Tumors account for over 30% of all bone cancer cases. They usually form in the same spots as osteosarcomas, with two exceptions. They can form in the cavities of the leg and arm bones, and can also <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/bone-cancer/about/types-of-bone-cancer')">form in soft tissues of the body near bones.</span> 
											
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
                                            
											Ewing Tumors are a bit different than Osteosarcomas, because they form from primitive cells, the oldest cells in the body. This doesnt mean they are treated differently: Ewing tumors still contain the same DNA abnormailities, and respond to all methods of treatment the same way other cancerous cells do.
											
											
											
											
											<br />
											<br />
                                            As of now, <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.webmd.com/cancer/ewings-sarcoma?page=2')">there are no environmental factors that contribute to the development of Ewing Tumors.</span> The only way to protect someone against this disease is to make sure that the person is diagnosed as soon as possible

                                            Chondrosarcomas are different than the other forms of bone cancer in one very specific way. Instead of infecting hard bones, <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://sarcomahelp.org/chondrosarcoma.html')">Chondrosarcomas actually go for the cartilage in the body.</span> They can still form in the hips, ribs and arm bones, but the key difference is that they can attack places with cartilage.
									
										<br />
										<br />
										
                                            Because of the fact that this type of Bone Cancer can affect cartilage, symptoms are the same as osteosarcomas, but with the addition of olfactory (smell) and auditory (hearing) loss, because those two areas are made up of mostly cartilage.

                                            In terms of bone cancer, proton therapy is especially revolutionary because it concentrates a beam of focused protons at the diseased section of the bone. It provides enough radiation to kill the cancerous cells, while sparing the surrounding cells.

                                            This form of cancer is unique because it utilizes a new form of treatment that has been becoming more popular over the past couple of years: <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://stemcells.nih.gov/info/basics/pages/basics1.aspx')">stem cells.</span> Traditionally, concentrated chemotherapy would cause the marrow in the bones to be destroyed. Unfortunately during this treatment they are. However, this specific form of therpay actually enables stems cells to come in, replace the bone marrow that was damaged or destroyed, giving a foundation for the patient, while still keeping the other healthy cells alive.

                           Even though the mortality rate of bone cancers has significantly dropped, it still takes away upwards of 1,500 people every year, most of them children. The incidence rate has shown no sign of letting up, causing pain for thousands of people worldwide every year. Through some of the organizations below, you can help the world get one step closer to relieveing not only current patients in pain, but prevent this problem from ever reoccurring in the future, something that is priceless to humanity. Check out these reputable organizations and take a step forward for the fight against bone cancer today!

                                            The BCRT has funded 35 peer-reviewed research projects since 2006, totalling £1,392,731, which equates to roughly $2,114,792. This massive sum of money has all gone towards the betterment of lives of people with bone cancer, and providing research in orderto prevent bone cancer from spreading even more. You can help take one step forward in this fight by donating money to their cause. Every dollar brings bone cancer closer to it's demise.
