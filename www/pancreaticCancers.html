                        Pancreatic Cancer comprise of tumors found in or near the pancreatic region of your body. The <span onClick = "window.open('http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/pancreatic-cancer/')"class = "link">pancreas</span> is a 6-inch long organ located behind the stomach in the back of the abdomen. It's function in the body is essential: it secretes hormones and sends them to glands in order to perform routine body functions like digesting fat and protein, spreading oxygen to the body, and producing excitatory hormones like dopamine and adrenaline. Pancreatic Cancer involves the uncontrollable growth of pancreatic cells that form tumors that impede normal functions of the pancreas to the point where a person is no longer able to function normally.
						
						<br />
						<br />
						
						Lets begin by going through the specifics of each type of Pancreatic Cancer as highlighted above. The graph below reveals the 2 different types of pancreatic cancers, and how prevalent they are in all total cases. The clear leader are Exocrine Tumors, with Endocrine Tumors covering a fraction of total Pancreatic Cancer cases

                                            Exocrine Tumors are easily the most common form of pancreatic cancer known. If anyone is diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, it is almost always referring to this specific type of tumor. Differentiating between Exocrine and Endocrine Tumors are very important, because each one is different in their own ways. Each one has a different prognosis, method of treatment, and outlook. Before delving into the specifics of exocrine tumors, first understand the workings of the pancreas.
                                            
                                                <br />
                                                <br />
                                               
                                            The <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocrine_gland')">exocrine glands</span> make pancreatic “juice,” which is released into the intestines. This juice contains enzymes that help you digest the food you eat. Without these, some of the food would just pass through your intestines without being absorbed. The enzymes are released into tiny tubes called ducts. These tiny ducts merge to form larger ducts, which empty into the pancreatic duct. The tumors block these passageways, restricting and sometimes even completely cutting off the flow of these tubes, which renders the body useless because of the lack of enzymes and hormones.
                                               
                                                <br />
                                                <br />
                                               
                                            The thing that makes Exocrine Cancers so deadly is the fact that it is connected to literally every single major functioning system in the body. Remember when we said that the enzymes and hormones produced by the pancreas travel to other organs to make them function? This gives the malignant tumors access to every single system in your body, which is why it <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis')">metastasizes</span> (spreads) so quickly. 
                    
                                               
                                                <br />
                                                <br />
                                                 
                                    Another reason why its so deadly is the fact that it is hard to detect early on. Even when pancreatic is pre-emptively found, its usually in the later stages and usually is so bad, that little can be done to reduce the mortality chance.

                                            Endocine Tumors occur significantly less than exocrine tumors because only about 5% of cells in the pancreas are <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis')">Enteroendocrine (Endocrine) Cells.</span> It is important to differentiate between Exocrine and Endocrine Tumors. For one, Exocrine Tumors have the ability to spread to other systems in the body, while endocrine tumors are able to spread only within the pancreas itself, limiting the mortality rate significantly.
											
											
											<br />
											<br />
											
                                            Another key difference between the two are their symptoms. Exocrine Cancers, like stated obove, affect the entire body, which can lead to anything ranging from <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/basics/definition/con-20028153')">yellow skin and eyes, fluid in the abdomen, extreme weight loss, to dark urine.</span> Endocrine Cancers on the other hand, can lead to symoptoms more related to moods and feelings, because of the concentration inside the pancreas, which produces hormones to do with feelings. Things like <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/endocrine-tumor/symptoms-and-signs')">irritability, severe depression, anxiety, and changes in bodily habits</span> are all part of the numerous detriments of endocrine tumors.

                            Through the rapid improvement of science and technology, medicine has allowed breakthroughs in the research and treatment of pancreatic cancer, and has resulted in the number of deaths per 100,000 people overall to <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/stomach.html')">decline since 1992.</span> Take a look at the graph below to see the specifics:

                                            Once a patient is diagnosed with any form of Pancreatic Cancer, the best doctors and other medical staff work with the patient to create the best possible treatment plan. <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.org/cancer/pancreaticcancer/detailedguide/pancreatic-cancer-treating-general-info')">There are a total of 4 specialized doctors that work with pancreatic cancers.</span> The radiation oncologist is a general cancer doctor that establishes the optimal treatment plan by using radiation treatment techniques. An endocrinologist is a doctor who treats diseases in glands that secrete hormones. This doctor mostly helps with the diagnosis and prognosis of the patient in question. There will also be a surgeon on the patients team, which will assist in removing the tumor manually if there is no other choice. Finally, the medical oncologist will specialize in chemotherapy and other medicines in order to assist the removal of the cancer.

                                            Depending on the type and stage of the cancer and other factors, treatment options for pancreatic cancer can include: <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/pancreatic/Patient/page5')">Palliative Surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or other clinical trials of new cancer-reducing medicines.</span> Sometimes, more than one of type of treatment might be used.

                                            Palliative surgery on the pancreas usually involves unblocking the <span class = "link" onClick = "window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct')">pancreatic ducts</span>, so that while the tumor isnt completely gone, other methods like radiation and chemotherapy can be used.

										<br />
										<br />
										
										Beams are generated outside the patient (usually by a linear accelerator, see below) and are targeted at the tumor site. These high energy x-rays can deposit their dose to the area of the tumor to destroy the cancer cells and, with careful treatment planning, spare the surrounding normal tissues. No radioactive sources are placed inside the patient's body.

                                            To accomplish their goals, the PANCAN prides itself on awarding over $23 Million dollars in grants to scientists who have made real impacts in the area of Pancreatic Cancers. They also provide many patient services to not only the patient, but their families as well, and is proud to have served over 90,000 families across the nation.

                                            This foundation would be absolutely nothing without the person most pivotal to their operations: You. Nothing would be possible without the help and funding of you, and all others around you.
